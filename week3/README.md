# Base types

1. Declare an `int` variable and print its value. Notice what the initial value
   of a variable is.
2. Assign a new value to the previous variable (it can be a constant value or
   can be read from the user with `scanf()`) and print if the value is even or
   odd.
3. Print if the number is positive or negative or zero.
4. Try to assign a floating point number, a char, a boolean and a string to the
   `int` variable. If the assignment is successful then print its value. Use
   `-W`, `-Wall`, and `-Wextra` flags during compilation.
5. Based on the previous example examine the conversion between all known base
   types. Can all types be converted to another? If yes, then what is the rule
   of conversion?
6. Determine the greatest and the smallest integer numbers (`sizeof`). Assign
   the greatest integer to a variable and add one. Check what happens.
7. Determine the average of two integers.

# Arrays

1. Create a program which fills up an array with zeros.
2. Create a program which adds up the integers of an array.
3. Create a program which prints the greatest element of an array.
4. Create a program which prints the second lowest element of an array.
5. Create a program which calculates the weighted sum of an array. The weights
   are listed in another array. For example: first array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
   second array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]. Weighted sum: 1\*1 + 1\*2 + 2\*3 + 3\*4 + 5\*5.
6. Create a program which swaps the smallest and greatest elements of an array.
