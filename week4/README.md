# Arrays

1. Create a program which calculates the length of a string.
2. Create a program which gets an array as input and determines whether it contains two amicable numbers. Two numbers are amicable if the sum of their divisors, that are less than themselves, equals the other. For example 220 and 284 are amicable.
3. Create a program which gets a string and counts the number of words. (Should work like wc command).

# Strings
1. Write a program that reads a string from the standard input and counts the number of characters and words in it! Use the fgets() function to read.
2. Write a program that reads a second string and compares it with the previous one! Do the task with a built-in operation from the string.h library, and without it.
