2. Create a program which adds up the integers of an array.
3. Create a program which prints the greatest element of an array.
4. Create a program which prints the second lowest element of an array.

   are listed in another array. For example: first array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
   second array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]. Weighted sum: 1*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 + 3*4 + 5*5.
6. Create a program which swaps the smallest and greatest elements of an array.
7. Create a program which calculates the length of a string.
